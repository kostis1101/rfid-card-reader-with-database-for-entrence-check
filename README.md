# rfid-card-reader-with-database-for-entrence-check
This programme was created for an MUN conference that would have taken place this year in my school.
I keeps track of who has already entered the dinner room. This was achieved by using python to handle the database and all the logic and adruino to read the rfids and send the necessery data to the python script via the serial port.
